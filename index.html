    <p>About Me </p>
       <ul>
	       
<p> After a long day of running tests on your program and fixing errors, there's always a sense of accomplishment once the code you've been figuring out finally works. It's fun to collaborate with others with in projects because of the spread of ideas. Someone can help you figure out something and vice versa. Having a common goal in mind makes people become more alruistic, friendly, and overall creates a very enjoyable work environment.  </p>

<p>Apart from programming I enjoy playing the viola, producing/composing music, and taking care of 3 chinchillas. Recently relocated to Houston, Texas, so I'm also exploring the city. </p>
